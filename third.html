	<b><p>Hampi is a temple town in India’s Karnataka state dotted with fascinating ancient Hindu temples and shrines. During its peak time,
	Hampi was one of the wealthiest cities in the world.
	Hampi was part of the ancient Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara whose rulers were known for their love of arts and culture,
	thirst for knowledge, and efficient rule. The Virupaksha Temple, the Queen’s Bath, 
	the Vittala Temple Complex are some of the most notable temples and monuments in Hampi.
	The place inspires the awe of all who visit Hampi and is thus rightly classified as one of the 7 wonders of India and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p></b>
