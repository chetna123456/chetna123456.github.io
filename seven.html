	<b><p>A large Buddhist monastery and a world-renowned center of learning between the 7th century BCE and 1200 CE, Nalanda well deserves to be one of the 7 wonders of India as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nalanda is located about 95 km from Patna, the capital city of Indiaâ€™s Bihar state. Nalanda is as one of the most famous universities in ancient India that was inspired by the highly organized methods of Vedic learning. The university flourished during the reign of the Gupta Empire and later during the rule of the emperor of Kannauj, Harshavardhana. Nalanda during its peak time was attended by scholars who came from near and far including knowledge-seekers from China, Korea, Central Asia, and Tibet. Sadly, it the University was ransacked and destroyed by a Muslim army of the Mamluk Dynasty in 1200 CE and was eventually abandoned and forgotten. Many years, later, the Government of modern India revived the site, and today it attracts a large number of tourists to the Indian state.
