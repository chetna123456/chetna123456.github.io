	<b><p>The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a vast complex of Jain and Hindu Temples, located in Khajuraho in India’s Madhya Pradesh state. The site has been declared as one of India’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Khajuraho temples are known across the world for their erotic sculptures and elegant nagara-style architectural symbols.</p>

<p>The Khajuraho temples and other monuments were built between 950 and 1050 by the rulers of the Chandela Dynasty. As per historical records, the site hosted 85 temples by the 12th century of which only about 20 survive to this date. The profusion of sculptures, intricate details, and symbolic designs all exhibit the great artistic wealth of ancient India. For all these reasons, it is regarded as one of the 7 wonders of India.
