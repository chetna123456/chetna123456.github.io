	<b><p>The Gomateshwara is a giant statue of Bahubali, a revered figure of the Jain community of India.
	Bahubali was Rishabhanatha's (the first Jain tirthankara) son. 
	Bahubali is said to have attained moksha or salvation by meditating while standing motionless for a year till climbing plants grew around his legs. 
	The giant Gommateshwara statue was thus built in ancient India to show respect to Bahubali. It is a 57-foot monolith that is located on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the Indian state of Karnataka. 
	The statue was built by Chavundaraya, a minister and commander of the Ganga Dynasty at about AD 981.</p></b>
